# talking_head_project_utils
Utils ddeveloped for working with project [Realistic-Neural-Talking-Head-Models](https://github.com/vincent-thevenin/Realistic-Neural-Talking-Head-Models) and [VoxCeleb2 dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html).

## Camera video stream utils
Here I provide two scripts: first one for recording video from camera to video file using OpenCV and second one for playing back a video from file.

## VoxCeleb2 dadaset utils
Here I provide a bash script or downloading videos from VoxCeleb2 dataset.
